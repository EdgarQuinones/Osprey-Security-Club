## Reflections

I don't think I would be where I am today if it weren't for OSEC. I met many great people. learned so much, and it made my college experience so much better. I wouldn't change a thing.

## Future Goals

The goal now is to keep learning to get a junior position at a SOC company. I will keep learning, doing competitions, and making projects as Cyber Security is something I very much enjoy working on.
